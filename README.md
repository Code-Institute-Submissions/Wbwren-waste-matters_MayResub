### Code Validation


### Functionality test
Error: textures were not appearing on matter.js shapes
Fix: disable render wireframes


Problem: Couldn't get polystyrene blocks to appear behind the compactor image in the canvas (3D effect)
Fix: The order in which you add objects to the world determines the z-index. Adding the foreground image 
of the compactor after the polystyrene blocks allows the blocks to appear behind the image, giving the desired 3D effect.
